### This app is totally free and open source you can take a look to all of the source file to know how it's working behind the scene but in future there will be a video in which I will explain the whole thing how it's working.

## Run it locally 
1. Clone the repo
2. Do a `npm install`
3. Put youtube API keys in the sample env file and rename it to `.env`
4. Run it using `npm start`
